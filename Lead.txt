Q.What is a Lead in Salesforce Sales Cloud?
Ans.In Salesforce Sales Cloud, a Lead represents a potential customer — someone who has shown interest in your product or service but hasn't been fully purchase yet.
Think of a Lead as the first step in the sales process.

Example of a Lead
1.Imagine you run a software company.
  Someone named Jane Doe visits your website and fills out a contact form to get more information.
  You collect her details: Name, Email, Company, Phone, etc.
2.This information becomes a Lead in Salesforce.
  Jane Doe is a Lead — she’s interested, but your sales team hasn’t yet verified if she’s a good fit.

Once your team contacts her and confirms she’s truly interested and qualified (for example, she has the budget and authority to buy), you can convert this Lead into:
  An Account (Jane’s company)
  A Contact (Jane herself)
  And possibly an Opportunity (a potential deal)

💡 What is a Converted Lead?
In Salesforce, a Lead is someone who might be interested in your product or service (like a potential customer).
When that lead becomes more serious — for example, they’re ready to talk about buying — you convert them into:
  an Account (the company),
  a Contact (the person), and
  an Opportunity (the potential sale).
🔁 How Can Leads Be Converted?
  You can convert them manually in Salesforce.
  Or, you can do it programmatically using the convertLead() function in code.

🔒 What Happens After Conversion?
Once a lead is converted:
  It becomes read-only (you can't edit it anymore by default).
  You can still view or search for it.
  Only users with special permission ("View and Edit Converted Leads") can update it.

🧾 Special Fields Set During Conversion
When a lead is converted, Salesforce fills in some special fields:
| Field                      | What It Means                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **IsConverted**            | True if the lead has been converted.         |
| **ConvertedDate**          | The date the lead was converted.             |
| **ConvertedAccountId**     | The ID of the new Account that was created.  |
| **ConvertedContactId**     | The ID of the new Contact.                   |
| **ConvertedOpportunityId** | The ID of the Opportunity (if one was made). |
| **Status**                 | The lead's final status before conversion.   |
